    "description": "At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all\\-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.\n   \n\n  \n\n To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands\\-on approach of an operator.\n   \n\n  \n\n For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.\n   \n\n  \n\n**A few examples of your responsibilities** \n* Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.\n* Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product\\-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.\n* Create brief, high\\-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.\n* Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.\n* Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.\n\n\n**What we look for** \n* **Reasoning ability.** \n Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.\n* **Drive.** \n You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.\n* **Team spirit.** \n You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.\n* **Proficiency in English.** \n You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.\n\n\n**What we offer** \n* **Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.** \n You’ll work in small, result\\-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.\n* **An exceptional opportunity for growth.** \n We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.\n* **Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.** \n Typically, we offer individuals at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in London and €63,965 elsewhere in Europe. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £194,964 in London, and €105,737 and €186,748 elsewhere in Europe. Compensation varies by location and expected impact, and grows rapidly as you gain experience and translate it into greater contributions. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.\n* **All. These. Benefits.** \n Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top\\-of\\-the\\-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.\n\n\n**Commitment \\& contract**\n Permanent or fixed\\-term. Full\\-time or part\\-time.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Location**\n Milan (Italy), London (UK), Madrid (Spain), Warsaw (Poland) or remote.\n   \n\n  \n\n**The selection process**\n If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.\n   \n\n  \n\n We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted severa",
